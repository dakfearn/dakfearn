## TL;DR
I build systems that remove friction.

Automation.  
Integrations.  
Data.  
AI — used carefully.

If it saves time, reduces risk, or creates leverage, I’m interested.

I like the messy middle.

The space between product, engineering, data, and ops.  
Where problems are cross-functional, slightly annoying, and important enough to matter.

I like turning:
- manual work into automation  
- fuzzy ideas into real systems  
- fragile setups into boring reliability

Customer impact comes first.  
Internal leverage follows when the system is right.

I ship outcomes.

Not demos.  
Not frameworks for the sake of frameworks.  
Real things that scale and keep working.

I stay hands-on.

I love getting my hands dirty.  
That hasn’t changed.

You’ll find me:
- designing integrations and shaping APIs  
- automating the boring, breakable stuff  
- modeling data, writing SQL, working in Snowflake  
- debugging edge cases and brittle systems  

Especially early. Especially messy. Especially high-impact.

A few things I’ve built at Tatango:
- scaled integrations into a core platform capability  
- ~10× growth in accounts using integrations  
- unlocked new TAM across major CRM & fundraising platforms  
- donation attribution and reporting tracking **$1B+** in nonprofit fundraising
- a modern data stack (Snowflake + dbt + Lightdash BI)  
- automation saving hundreds of product hours per year  

Most of this never shows up in release notes — but teams feel it.

---

My general rules:
- start with the outcome  
- define “done” early  
- make tradeoffs explicit  
- progress beats perfection  
- “we’ll clean it up later” isn’t a plan  

---

Tools I reach for often:
Tray, Zapier, n8n, Postman, Claude Code, ChatGPT

---

Right now, I’m focused on:
- making integrations a real platform advantage  
- deeper bi-directional CRM sync  
- self-serve integration setup  
- standardized configuration that scales

If this ever feels aspirational instead of accurate, call it out.
