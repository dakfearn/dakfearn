## TL;DR
I build systems that remove friction.

Automation, integrations, data, and thoughtful AI — all in service of real outcomes.  
If it saves time, reduces risk, or creates leverage for the people doing the work, I’m interested.

This README is how I think about building and how I tend to show up when we work together.

## The Work I Gravitate Toward
I spend most of my time where things are:
- cross-functional
- slightly messy
- important enough to matter
- annoying enough that no one wants to own them

That usually means living between product, engineering, data, and ops — translating intent into systems that actually scale.

Some recurring themes:
- integrations that don’t need babysitting  
- automation that replaces manual steps instead of adding process  
- data paths people trust without double-checking  
- AI used as leverage, not theater  

**Customer impact matters.**

## How I Tend to Build
I don’t love ceremony. I do love clarity.

- Start with the outcome, not the solution  
- Make tradeoffs explicit early  
- Define what “done” means before we build  
- Prefer paved roads over clever one-offs  

I bias toward:
- automation over headcount  
- defaults over documentation  
- systems doing the boring work  

Progress beats perfection — but “we’ll clean it up later” isn’t a plan.

## A Quick Take on AI
AI is a tool. Not the product.

I’m interested when it:
- removes effort or decision fatigue  
- fits naturally into an existing workflow  
- has guardrails, visibility, and a human override  

If it creates noise, fragility, or trust issues, it’s probably not worth shipping.

## When I Get Hands-On
I love staying hands-on and getting my hands dirty.

You’ll find me in:
- integration design and API contracts  
- automation logic (Tray, Zapier, scripts, workflows)  
- data modeling, SQL, Snowflake  
- debugging edge cases and brittle systems  

Especially early, messy, or high-impact problems.

## Stuff I’ve Built at Tatango
Most of my impact shows up as **systems**, not splashy features.

Highlights:
- Built and scaled Tatango’s integrations ecosystem into a core platform capability  
- ~10× growth in accounts using integrations since joining  
- Opened meaningful new TAM across major CRM and fundraising platforms  

On the data side:
- Donation attribution and reporting pipelines tracking **$1B+**  
- **1B+ messages** flowing through analytics and reporting  
- Reporting adoption up **~3–4×**

Internally:
- Modernized the data stack (Snowflake + dbt + BI)  
- Implemented product analytics, CDP, and session replay  
- Introduced structured experimentation  
- Built internal automation saving **hundreds of product hours per year**

A lot of this never shows up in release notes — but teams feel it.

---

## What I’m Focused On Right Now
- Turning integrations into a real platform advantage  
- Deepening CRM integrations into true bi-directional sync  
- Moving toward self-serve integration setup  
- Standardizing configuration to cut onboarding time and errors  

The goal is simple:  
**higher volume, less custom work, systems that scale without heroics.**

---

## Lessons Earned (Not Theoretical)
- Flexibility before standards creates long-term drag  
- Internal users matter as much as external ones  
- Instrumentation is part of the feature  
- Not every problem needs UI — sometimes a system is enough  

These shape how I build now.

---

## Working With Me
You’ll get:
- direct feedback, early  
- quick help when you’re blocked  
- context on *why* something matters  

I expect:
- clear ownership  
- thoughtful tradeoffs  
- early communication when something feels off  

Once we decide, we move.

If this doc ever feels aspirational instead of accurate, call it out.  
Alignment matters more than polish.
